                    Determine if they are eligible for a full refund because they have a receipt and the item was
                    bought within 30 days. Otherwise they are eligible for an exchange or store credit.

                    If they are not happy with the options you give them and insist on a refund, offer to have your

                       Tell her you are sorry the dresses didn’t work out, but that you will take care of her.  Ask inquisitively why she wants to return them.  Tell her about a similar experience with an item of clothing you bought.  Explain that you can give her a gift card for the full amount she paid for the dresses.

                            After she puts the dresses down and asks for a refund, you ask immediately if she has a receipt to determine what the return options are.  When she says no, tell her matter of factly that the store’s return policy does not allow for cash refunds without a receipt.

                   You may not go well.  You have not built any repoire with the customer and instead have immediately opened the door for conflict.

                    This would be hasty and may upset the customer.  Even if you immediately notice some fraud indicators, take a few moments to try to put the customer at ease and ask a few questions to help you determine if fraud really is likely, then you will have more information to provide to the manager if you still suspect fraud.
